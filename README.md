Directory Structure for Deep Learning Assignments
### This directory consists of CNN models, Data Augmentation Methods, Training and Testing functions in a modular form. It also contains a GradCam class to analyse missclassified images in a classification problem ###

Models folder contains three customized ResNet18 architectures:
1. *resnset.py* for gradcam example
2. *custom_resnet.py* for 90% on Cifar10 data in 24 epochs
3. *resnet18_64.py* for TinyImageNet data set with input size of 64x64
